# Parking Lot Management System

This is a simple Parking Lot Management System built with Java and Spring Boot.

## Overview

The system manages a parking lot with a total of 25 spaces. It supports three types of vehicles: CAR, VAN, and MOTORCYCLE. Each vehicle type requires a different number of parking spots and prefers a certain type of spot.

## Features

- **Park a Vehicle:** The system can park a vehicle if there are enough available spots of the preferred type. The number of required spots depends on the vehicle type: a CAR or a MOTORCYCLE requires 1 spot, while a VAN requires 3 spots.

- **Vehicle Leaves:** A vehicle can leave the parking lot, freeing up the occupied spots.

- **Save a Parking Spot:** The system can save a new parking spot. However, the total number of spots cannot exceed 25.

- **Check Available Spots:** The system can check the number of available spots.

- **Check if All Spots are Taken:** The system can check if all spots of a certain type are taken.
